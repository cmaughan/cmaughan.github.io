I seem to have the dreaded altimeter issue on my Garmin 910xt.  It thinks I&#8217;m at 20km above sea level when I first turn it on, then slowly dives down to -20km over time.  Searching around a bit on the web, I found other people complaining of a similar defect in their watches and requesting replacements from Garmin (you can check yours by going into the diagnostic screens.  Hold Enter, hold power, when you see the diagnostics, release the buttons and start pressing Mode until you see the barometer information &#8211; if one of the numbers is high and changing, and the other is 0, you&#8217;re probably unlucky).

I&#8217;d heard good things about customer service, but this morning when I called they asked for £75 to replace the unit.  That seems a little unfair, given that this is a known fault in the manufacture, from what I can tell <img src="http://www.chrismaughan.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />  It&#8217;s also galling, given the amount I&#8217;ve spent on Garmin kit over the years.
