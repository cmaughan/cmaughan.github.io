<img class="alignleft" title="Chat" src="http://www.chrismaughan.com/wp-content/themes/platformpro/images/fbox1.png" alt="" width="100" height="100" />Welcome to my new blog.  Hopefully I&#8217;ll write something more useful than &#8216;Hello World&#8217; in the next few days <img src="http://www.chrismaughan.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />

I&#8217;m just figuring out the finer details of WordPress, Amazon EC2 hosting, and various other bits and pieces to get this blog up and running.  I would appear to have a working website, so that&#8217;s a good start!
