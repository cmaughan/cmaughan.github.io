In my last post, I showed the results of FTP test measurement.  Here I&#8217;m trying to measure my Aerobic Efficiency.  To calculate this, I did a 10 minute warm-up (not shown), followed by a steady Z2 heart rate workout for 35 minutes.  For me, I should be around 145 to be in the middle of HR zone 2 on the bike &#8211; which I can figure out from the values measured in my FTP test.  It was harder than I expected to keep my heart rate constant, and I ended up with it a little low for the duration of the test &#8211; around 141 according the the data.  As before, I&#8217;m not used to pacing on the Wattbike, and I lost my concentration near the end &#8211; unintentionally speeding up a bit before correcting.  I&#8217;m also starting to get down on the drops as my arm flexibility improves, which does vary my output somewhat.  Next time I&#8217;ll know roughly the setting I should be shooting for, and be a little more disciplined!

Although 30 minutes should work for this test, I suspect an hour or so might give a more even set of data.  To make this test accurate, you simply need to keep your heart as steady as possible in whatever zone you&#8217;ve picked.  I wanted an &#8216;easy&#8217; workout, so I chose Z2 for the test.

This time the dip in the graph is intentional, since I got up to open a window!  I also smoothed the graph to give a better view of what&#8217;s going on.  I guess it&#8217;s an issue that my workouts are typically done in a much warmer environment that I would be in outside.  But as long as this is consistent, it shouldn&#8217;t be a problem.

Firstly, as you can see from Training Peaks, you get great analysis data of your ride &#8211; much better than Strava.  The &#8216;**EF**&#8216; (Efficiency Factor) number is 1.18.  This is the ratio of Watts I generated to HR.  The idea here is that as I get more aerobically fit, the number should go up &#8211; since the watts I generate for a given HR during an aerobic workout should slowly rise &#8211; as long as I keep the HR at the same value each time.  The nice thing about this workout is that I can throw it in on any day when I don&#8217;t feel up to a harder interval session.  It will be interesting to see the number rise.  Additionally, if the number starts to level out, that means I need to do something to push myself to improve.

The second interesting thing here is commonly known as decoupling. Training Peaks display this as **Pwr:Hr**, and the number is ~8% in this case.  What this represents is the change in my heart rate vs wattage for the duration of the test.  It&#8217;s quite visible in the graph &#8211; you can see the pink wattage line diverging from the red line.  According to Joe Friel, this is a little high and represents &#8216;poor&#8217; aerobic efficiency.  No surprise there, since I&#8217;ve been sat on my backside for most of this year.  But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s too bad, and I suspect it is a little skewed due to this being my first go at the test.  I like a number I know I can improve; since that&#8217;s the point of measuring this stuff&#8230;..

And for completeness, here are the other interesting values that Training Peaks gives you, among others:

**IF** &#8211; Intensity Factor &#8211; the % of my FTP during this workout.  Here, 75% of my FTP; around the intensity I would typically hope to do a Half Ironman bike at.

**VI** &#8211; Variability Index &#8211; the variability of my performance during the test (about 1% in this case &#8211; as it should be)

**Power Balance** &#8211; The ratio of left to right leg power.  Very close in my case, though I have noticed that during intense workouts my &#8216;right&#8217; side tends to work a bit harder than my left.

**W/Kg** &#8211; The wattage I generated per Kg of body weight (not expected to be high, since this was a Z2 workout)

**NP** &#8211; Normalized Power &#8211; a better measure of Power based on the variable intensity of the ride (note that it is almost the same as average wattage in this case &#8211; as you&#8217;d expect for a steady ride).  If I&#8217;d climbed a few mountains you&#8217;d expect NP to be much greater than Average Power &#8211; giving a much better representation of the effort I put in.  I&#8217;m not sure why Strava choose a different version of this (theirs is &#8216;Average Weighted Power&#8217;, and seems consistently lower than NP).<figure id="attachment_242" style="width: 901px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
