Please note that the Boardz Server will be decommissioned before the end of the year.  The financial reality is that the server costs far outstrip the sales.  An attempt to add in-app purchases didn’t help, and most players just reduced their active games so they didn’t have to pay the subscription.  On a personal note, I’ve been propping up the Boardz servers for the last 6 months, simply because it’s a piece of software close to my heart.  I’m sorry to see it go.

Boardz may be back one day, but for now it is not a supportable proposition, and I don’t have the time to work on new features & updates.  It’s been a fun ride!
