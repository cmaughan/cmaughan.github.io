&lt;p&gt;Myself and my partner Mahy approached it using C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our solution works by making an array of commonly used words and splicing them together using some rather convoluted code!  I think it could still go a little smaller, but it does get hard to tweak the more ‘optimal’ you make it.  There are some repeated words that could probably save a bit more.
The final size of the program is somewhere below 700 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few simple tricks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The macro saves characters, and completes the previous line&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is in inner loop for the repeated verse which selects pairs of animals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;initializing the ints globaly sets them to zero (something I’d forgotten)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of this exercise is to get you to think outside the box, and gain a deeper understanding of the limitations &amp;amp; features of the language you choose.  There’s a theory that says our perception of the world is based on the internal language we use to describe it.  Certainly, it is true for programming languages; they each have their quirks.&lt;/p&gt;

He’s down to a 4 or 5 stone handicap now.  Here is the final state of a recent game he won (I didn’t record the captures). As is often the case, I have trouble making life in the corners when playing against a handicap; something I need to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although 30 minutes should work for this test, I suspect an hour or so might give a more even set of data.  To make this test accurate, you simply need to keep your heart as steady as possible in whatever zone you’ve picked.  I wanted an ‘easy’ workout, so I chose Z2 for the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time the dip in the graph is intentional, since I got up to open a window!  I also smoothed the graph to give a better view of what’s going on.  I guess it’s an issue that my workouts are typically done in a much warmer environment that I would be in outside.  But as long as this is consistent, it shouldn’t be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, as you can see from Training Peaks, you get great analysis data of your ride – much better than Strava.  The ‘&lt;strong&gt;EF&lt;/strong&gt;‘ (Efficiency Factor) number is 1.18.  This is the ratio of Watts I generated to HR.  The idea here is that as I get more aerobically fit, the number should go up – since the watts I generate for a given HR during an aerobic workout should slowly rise – as long as I keep the HR at the same value each time.  The nice thing about this workout is that I can throw it in on any day when I don’t feel up to a harder interval session.  It will be interesting to see the number rise.  Additionally, if the number starts to level out, that means I need to do something to push myself to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second interesting thing here is commonly known as decoupling. Training Peaks display this as &lt;strong&gt;Pwr:Hr&lt;/strong&gt;, and the number is ~8% in this case.  What this represents is the change in my heart rate vs wattage for the duration of the test.  It’s quite visible in the graph – you can see the pink wattage line diverging from the red line.  According to Joe Friel, this is a little high and represents ‘poor’ aerobic efficiency.  No surprise there, since I’ve been sat on my backside for most of this year.  But I don’t think it’s too bad, and I suspect it is a little skewed due to this being my first go at the test.  I like a number I know I can improve; since that’s the point of measuring this stuff…..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for completeness, here are the other interesting values that Training Peaks gives you, among others:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IF&lt;/strong&gt; – Intensity Factor – the % of my FTP during this workout.  Here, 75% of my FTP; around the intensity I would typically hope to do a Half Ironman bike at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VI&lt;/strong&gt; – Variability Index – the variability of my performance during the test (about 1% in this case – as it should be)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power Balance&lt;/strong&gt; – The ratio of left to right leg power.  Very close in my case, though I have noticed that during intense workouts my ‘right’ side tends to work a bit harder than my left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W/Kg&lt;/strong&gt; – The wattage I generated per Kg of body weight (not expected to be high, since this was a Z2 workout)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP&lt;/strong&gt; – Normalized Power – a better measure of Power based on the variable intensity of the ride (note that it is almost the same as average wattage in this case – as you’d expect for a steady ride).  If I’d climbed a few mountains you’d expect NP to be much greater than Average Power – giving a much better representation of the effort I put in.  I’m not sure why Strava choose a different version of this (theirs is ‘Average Weighted Power’, and seems consistently lower than NP).&lt;figure id=&quot;attachment_242&quot; style=&quot;width: 901px;&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first test I’ve done has been to measure my FTP (Functional Threshold Power).  This is the amount of power I would typically generate over the course of a 1 hour race, with nothing left on the table.  Knowing this number gives 2 things – I can use it to measure progress, and I can figure out my optimal training zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I wasn’t used to the Wattbike (it’s a much smoother ride, and the air resistance it very different to the turbo) it took me a couple of attempts to pace the test, but the end result seems about right.  My power is about 223 according to Strava.  At my peak, before injury, I was around 260.  I suspect the Wattbike is measuring higher than the estimates I got from Strava on the turbo, but  50 watts feels about right – I can believe that’s where I am at relative to the start of the year.   You might spot that this isn’t actually a full hour on the bike – it’s 30 minutes (after a warm-up which isn’t shown).  Joe Friel reckons in his ‘[Power Meter Handbook][1]‘ that a turbo session indoors is roughly equivalent to a 1 hour race outdoors – and if that means I only have to suffer through this gruelling test for 30 minutes, I’m in ;)  This is undoubtedly the toughest indoor ride I do – you need quite a bit of mental strength to hold on for the full duration – and I’m actually making it harder these days by going all out for a full 30 minutes.  You can see that nice steady climb in heart rate, right up to my max.  The Wattbike manual has alternative, less stressful ‘progress’ checking tests, which I will definitely try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a strange drop of speed on the graph; I didn’t actually stop – and the power/cadence values are constant, so hopefully that’s just a glitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next test I want to do is a Zone 2 constant heart rate test, to get a baseline aerobic efficiency.  I’m also going to add a pedalling technique session to try to improve my power output over the whole pedal stroke.  Mostly, I’m going to continue with my program of interval sessions to build up my fitness/power as fast as I can.  My target is 300 watts by this time next year, in time for Ironman Barcelona….  I’ll post about future tests when I’ve done them.&lt;/p&gt;

It is slightly bemusing that so many riders I meet on the day don’t have hard data to figure out how they are doing; I couldn’t live without the GPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decide to get to T2 so I can call my wife and meet up.  The only problem is the little voice in my head that’s responsible for me doing this race in the first place.  It’s saying ‘you can do this….’.  I leave my fellow cyclists to their fate, and decide to at least make the cut-off.  Next year, I’ll know I can do the first 2/3 of the race, I say to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weekend so far has been fantastic.  I’ve never seen such a well organised event.  With half of Bolton closed off, 1600 athletes getting ready for a race, and a complicated course involving transition areas and finish line all miles apart, I’m amazed things are going so well.  Stacey, my wife, has been a star – driving me to T1 to deposit my bike and blue transition bag, T2 to deposit my red transition bag, and the Reebock Stadium to watch the race briefing, eat some pasta, and shop for goodies.  I feel like a fraud buying an Ironman beer glass (I tell myself I’m going to celebrate with it later), but I whip out the credit card regardless.  I also pick up a beanie and the race shirt containing all the athlete’s names in tiny writing.  The pasta party is fun, and I enjoy the food despite the fact that I don’t eat much dairy these days.  Part of my transformation over the last couple of years from couch potato to triathlete has involved a major change to a mostly plant-based diet.  It’s enabled me to lose 3 stone and recover quickly enough to absorb the training that has got me here.  At the party, Greg Whyte is there to talk to the audience and give advice; he’s trying for Kona, but I hear later on that he didn’t manage it – despite a stonking first Ironman time of 11.49.  Greg is charismatic, and his advice is ‘race your own race’.  It is good advice which I take to heart, and repeat to myself throughout the course.  It helps keep me slow and relaxed on the swim (a miracle!), and stops me taking nutrition I haven’t had before – at least until the end of the bike, when I’m desperately looking for a quick fix and eat a ‘cookies and cream’ bar.  Yuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I make it to the lake with 90 minutes to spare, having already eaten an entire bar of dark chocolate and my homemade bread and avocado sandwich with almond butter, time just flows away.  Once I’ve checked the bike, put on my wetsuit and kissed Stacey goodbye, there are 30 minutes to go when I decide I have to go to the toilet.  I then spend the next 25 minutes queuing for the portaloos. In an otherwise faultlessly organised event, I’m surprised at the short supply, and my fellow athletes are  complaining loudly about the same thing, as they snake off in a long line around the toilets.  I’m told the queues on the other side of the transition area are even bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;pull-right&quot; style=&quot;padding: 10px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/ironman/swim-199x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wetsuit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 2 minutes left I slide into the water, completely forgetting that I have a magic ‘Clif Shot Double Espresso Gel’ in my tri suit pocket – now trapped inside my wetsuit!  This being my third triathlon (I completed a Sprint at Allerthorpe in York a couple of months before this, and a half distance at Belvoir Castle a week before that), I knew what to expect.  It goes like this: Get into the water.  Start swimming.  Splutter.  Come up gasping for breath.  Try breaststroke.  Try freestyle again.  Repeat for about 30 minutes until I settle down and relax into my usually OK freestyle stroke.  Although usually a good swimmer, I’ve found that open water swimming in the cold closes up my lungs and gives me really bad asthma until I’ve warmed up.  For some reason the gods are smiling on me today though.  I glide into the water, set off on my swim and everything just works, as it normally would in the pool.  The sun comes up just as we set off, the water is warm, and the view is glorious.  I’m trying not to swallow water as I laugh with glee and for the first time ever, enjoy my open water swim.  I’m having so much fun, that I have to keep forcing myself to hold back and take it easy, and my biggest problem is getting past people, since I deliberately started right at the back, thinking that’s where I’d stay.  I even take a fist to my left goggle eye and a few kicks, but I don’t care.  Barber’s Adagio for Strings seems to be my ‘setting off on an adventure’ theme tune these days, and I hear it in my head as I thoroughly enjoy myself.  The Australian exit is no problem at all, and I calmly walk around it before dropping into the lake for the second lap.  I’m in no rush for the swim to end, and I’m almost sad to see the finish area.  The Strava data frompu my swim is below.  The official time of 1:20:46 puts me in 183 place of 337 in my age group, and a long way before the swim cut-off of 2:20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/72283145/embed/e543bf9d21128d47b64b0e9c84d135ecd23f2e07&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time for the bit I’ve been most worried about.  My aching back is going to suffer during this ride, and my nagging worries about not doing enough long bike rides due to the injury are at the front of my mind.  After almost 15 minutes of messing about in T1, I jump on the bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;pull-left&quot; style=&quot;padding: 10px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/ironman/T1-199x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bike&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I deliberately hold back on nutrition for 10 minutes into the ride, then take a caffeine energy gel – a tip I’d read beforehand from Chrissie Wellington about letting my stomach settle after the swim.  It does the trick, and for the first time I don’t feel sick during the ride.  A slight headache is probably due to the stress on my body, but I take an extra Salt Stick tablet to be safe.  The first lap goes OK – I feel good, reasonably strong, and enjoy the tapered feeling of no pain in my legs.  I tackle all the hills in the saddle, spinning in a high gear, and try to keep my heart rate down and stay in my endurance zone.  My wife has managed to find a pub on the route to sit outside, and she screams at me as I fly past – it’s a great lift to see her.  It isn’t until I work my way back to the start of the loop that I realise how far each circuit is, and how much my back is going to hurt.  Reluctantly I take an Ibuprofen – brought with me in case of emergency, since I hate taking medication.  Since I switched to a plant-based diet, I’ve had little need for drugs of any kind – I just don’t get sick any more, and I’ve always hated taking tablets.  The Ibuprofen works wonders though, and I thank the Gods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;pull-right&quot; style=&quot;padding: 10px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/ironman/bikehill-199x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bike on the hill&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the relief, I find myself at the end of lap 2 with the realisation I’m in trouble.  As I set off on the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; lap, I become more determined to make it, even though I intend to stop.  Burning all my matches at once, I go round the last lap as fast as I can.  I never see any of the lads I chatted to at the aid station, and I pass several on the way round.  The last hour or so is brutal.  I’ve used whatever energy I had left, the wind is at its peak and the heavens have opened.  I’m like a drowned, crippled, exhausted rat as I fight through the last few hills.  At one point I look up to the sky and say ‘Really??!’.  It feels like a test, and I’m sure somebody has it in for me.  Becoming convinced that a finish-me-off puncture is surely on the way, I arrive at the darkest part of my day.  But there’s that voice again…. ‘You can do this’….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 2 minutes to spare before the bike cut-off, I fly into transition and ask the guys how long I have to get out of T2.  I realise this is a stupid question because I’m not continuing, but there’s part of me that isn’t having any of that.   I am the last man standing in the whole race; nobody else makes it in time, and I only see one fellow who came in before me, who leaves the changing room as I sit and contemplate how to phone my wife.   The bike has taken me 8:47, and my age group rank has fallen to 274 – meaning that the remaining 63 people in my age group haven’t made it.  The Strava data below shows that I’ve climbed about 2100 meters during the bike.  With only 114 watts average power, it’s not my finest ride, but it is certainly the longest I’ve ever done by some 80 kilometers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps because I’m on auto-pilot, it only hits me some time later, that I forgot to pick up my electrolytes and that emergency bar of chocolate when I set out on the run.  I do like what I find out about myself when I exercise for a long time; it’s a reason I do it, along with being fit and healthy for the sake of my family.  Today I find out that I’ve set off on the marathon with almost no conscious decision.  One minute,  I’m sat thinking about calling my wife, 10 minutes later I’m shuffling along the road at the very back of the race.  The marshal I pass calls out to me to tell me I’ve took a wrong turn, and ask if I’m in the race.  She’s been dozing, and probably decided that nobody else is coming.  I start doing maths in my head, trying to figure out how fast I have to move to finish the race.  I can barely stay standing, but combine walking with running and just try to keep moving.  The maths tells me there’s no chance in hell, but it’s hard to trust it because my head isn’t working right, and I can’t add 2 and 2 at this point.  Eventually I catch a guy called Jez, who’s in the 55-59 age group.  He tells me he’s done Ironman many times, and is doing the race this year despite 3 heart operations and the advice of his doctor.  We adopt a brisk walk for a while and chat about the race so far.  Jez assures me we will make it to the finish in time, and although I’m not sure if I believe him, it gives me hope and I plough on beside him.  We reach the end of the route along the Bolton canal, and enter the 3.5 loops of the circuit we have to do to finish.  Each loop is 10km, and we get a wrist band after each circuit.  When we have 3 we can take the alternative turn at the bottom of the hill in the center of Bolton to claim our medal.  This is pretty cruel because all around you are fellow competitors who have 1,2 or 3 wrist bands, and you know you have way more work to do before you’re in that position.  It takes more than an hour for me to get the first one, and even though I’ve covered a half marathon, I’m not convinced I can get to the end in time.  The run course follows a path down into the town, and I try to run these sections, then walk the up sections on the way back.  This works for a while, but I’m going painfully slow, and cramp has started to settle into my calves and shins.  Another cruelty  is the way you pass the announcer shouting ‘Competitor X, You are an Ironman!’, before turning around 3 times to run back up the hill.  Again, my wife Stacey is a life saver as she is waiting for me at the bottom of the hill with fresh supplies.  This is the only spot where your friends and family are allowed to offer assistance in the whole race.  She is screaming like crazy, and panicking that I won’t make it.  I assure her I will – “There’s nothing I can’t do”.  But I’m not sure I believe it.  At one point she passes me a panini and a coffee.  The taste of solid food and a hot drink is fantastic, but it doesn’t sit well on my stomach and I don’t finish it.  I share half of it with Jez, and this is the last time I see him, some time during lap 2.  At the beginning of lap 3 I’m in a lot of pain, but somehow I’m moving.  ‘Sod it’, I think, and discard my jacket when I pass Stacey.  I start to run up the hill, determined to make a good effort of the last lap.  At this point I realise I’m going to make it.  I have 90 minutes to complete 10km – a distance I can usually manage in less than 50 minutes.  Unfortunately my legs have other ideas and I feel two stabbing needle-like pains at the top of my left calf.  I’m not stupid – I can tell that I’m about to lose the ability to move forward, so I instantly stop and start walking again.  After a few minutes I give it another try, but the same pain arrives almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;pull-right&quot; style=&quot;padding: 10px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/ironman/Finish-Shute-199x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Finish shute&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then discover that I can do a very narrow shuffle-run without too much pain, so I switch to that – it is marginally faster than walking.  As I come down the hill into town for the finish, my wife is screaming at me from the back of what looks like a garbage buggy – they’ve come to find me! The last few meters are heaven and the finish is truly special as &lt;a title=&quot;Paul Kaye Twitter&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kayeman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Paul Kaye&lt;/a&gt; is stood on the red carpet screaming into the microphone – I can hear him building up the crowd for my arrival as I round the corner into town.  He comments that Stacey is louder than the massive crowd – ‘his wife is going bezerk!!’, and he’s right – I can hear her shouting over the top of all the cheering.  I’ve done it.  The run hasn’t been my finest moment, or perhaps it has, but it doesn’t matter any more.  I’ve achieved what I set out to do, and with only 10 minutes to spare – my official time is 16:52:05.  I am also last in my age group, and I think 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; from the end, with Jez not far behind me.  In all the excitement and commotion I don’t get to see him after we finish, but my wife tells me he crosses the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My run data is below – it’s taken 6:09:30 to complete the marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/72283764/embed/1bfe4583bb67479ee1c15ec36dfdd879d23915c7&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easily one of the best days of my life, the Ironman was truly special.  I couldn’t have done it without all the support from my wife and family.  Crossing that finish line has been a year-long effort, with early morning runs, lunch time swims, and evening sessions on the turbo – not to mention long rides and runs at the weekend, and a knee operation for good measure!  I’m 3 stone lighter, and fitter than I’ve ever been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all good :)&lt;/p&gt;

It is slightly bemusing that so many riders I meet on the day don’t have hard data to figure out how they are doing; I couldn’t live without the GPS.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A History of Boardz, Part 3</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/boardz-part3" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A History of Boardz, Part 3" /><published>2012-11-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2012-11-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/a-history-of-boardz-part-3</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/boardz-part3">&lt;p&gt;This is the final part of my posts on the history of Boardz.  I’m going to talk about the artwork and the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###Artwork&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artwork for Boardz was one of the most time consuming parts of the project.  I made the wrong decision early on that I wanted to do all the work myself, including the art.  I found a few pieces of free artwork on places like wikimedia commons, and bought some 3D models on TurboSquid, but the rest of the artwork was either drawn by myself, or generated on the fly procedurally.  My approach to a lot of this was pretty unusual I think, mainly because I was trying to find the best solution that was within my limited artistic abilities.  As an example, I knew I couldn’t model 3D chess pieces, so I bought a set of Staunton 3DSMax files, even though I was rendering the board in 2D, using OpenGL.  To get the 3D look, I rendered the pieces in Max, then I took screenshots of the renderings and used them as sprites in the game.  This worked pretty well, and I think my Staunton 3D set is one of the best looking sets on the App Store – it’s easy to see the pieces, without the 3D look making it hard to follow the game, and it looks very traditional.  I followed a similar approach for other games such as Go, and did some rudimentary modelling for pieces in Shogi – the ‘squashed pyramid’ shape of Shogi pieces was just about within my modelling ability.  The 3D pieces were in some ways easier to do because of this approach.  The 2D sets were much harder.  Although I could find free imagery for sets, I didn’t particularly like the quality of these images.  I spent a lot of time fiddling with individual pixels in photoshop, playing with blending modes, and sharpening/softening images.  I also spent endless hours tweaking filtering and rendering code to build up a 2D graphic on the screen that I liked.  Fitting a full set of Shogi pieces onto a 320 pixel screen is particularly challenging – the Kanji characters in their full versions are very detailed and hard to see at that screen size, not to mention the large capture area required, and the 9×9 board.  For that reason, I offered an optional reduced set of pieces with just the first character of the pair displayed – quite a common approach in the literature for shogi (newspaper columns often use a reduced set to document tournament games).  I later realized that I could have easily generated Kanji characters at any resolution by simply firing up Word and typing them in, but this was much later in the project when I worked on the iPad version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, I chose to draw all the artwork using OpenGL ES.  For a 2D game, this is somewhat unusual, but for me it was a natural fit because I’m a 3D graphics programmer and most comfortable with 3D API’s.  Had I employed an artist to generate all the 2D artwork, and made use of the 2D graphics API’s I suspect I would have completed the project sooner, and with less difficulty.  Doing all the graphics myself meant I needed to work out how to handle animation, as well as combining iPhone 2D elements with my 3D renderer.  All that aside, for future projects I will still draw everything using OpenGL, but also generate all 2D user interface elements in the same renderer.  It’s really the only way to get a cross-platform game up and running without having to port all of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the pieces sorted out, I needed to draw the boards.  This part was a little easier, and involved finding some woodwork art, and writing some code to draw the lines onto the boards procedurally.  Being able to draw any size/shape of board in this way made it easy to offer different sizes of Go Board, and alternative games such as Mini Shogi.  For the most part the wood textures looked good, although on later versions I dialled back all the wood a bit and added a nice green felt texture for the backdrop.  I also added some small touches, such as fake shadows on the pieces, and scaling, etc. to give the illusion that the pieces were being lifted up/put down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;server&quot;&gt;Server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Boardz, I’d never written any web based code at all.  Sure, I’d ran the odd sample ASPX demo and tweaked a little PHP code here and there, but apart from that I didn’t have the first clue about how to implement a server for a turn-based game.  After a lot of research, I came to the conclusion that I wanted to do a RESTful API, with very minimal web front end; since everything would be communicated through the iPhone client.  Installing and setting up a Linux server on a web host quickly convinced me that it was going to take a lot of maintenance, so I began looking around for easier solutions.  At the time, Microsoft’s REST story was not complete and difficult to understand, and I was nervous about maintaining and hosting IIS on a server – not to mention my total lack of experience with SQL Server.  At that point I discovered Rails, the web framework that runs on Ruby.  The nice thing about Rails is the way it abstracts the database from you, and makes it easy to build an app without writing SQL statements or managing the database.  For someone like me it was perfect, and after a few tutorials I was convinced it was going to work well.  At the time, I decided to leave the deployment problem until later on, but I eventually found &lt;a title=&quot;Heroku&quot; href=&quot;http://www.heroku.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; and didn’t look back.  Heroku is a cloud host which makes it easy to deploy Rails apps; it’s one of the best pieces of software technology I’ve ever used – it’s trivial to get a Rails app running in the cloud, initially even for free.  You don’t have to worry about packaging up your app for deployment, you just push your git branch up to their server and a few moments later you are live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems I had with the server mostly came down to my lack of experience.  I had some issues with my assumptions about how the Ruby language worked which bit me for a long time, and some problems with synchronising moves being made by the clients.  It took a while to get the authentication working with HTTPS too – installing an HTTPS certificate on a website and communicating securely is a bit confusing when you first set it up; and you have to be careful to get it right!  Getting the client to work with the secure connection also turned out to be very tricky due to the state of the SSL browser support in the phone –  which was improved by newer versions of iOS and became a non-issue over time.  To this day, the only real problems I get from users using Boardz are with the authentication/login.  Mostly these are just problems with firewalls, etc., but in future I’ll try really hard to make the authentication use OpenID/Facebook/Google, etc. and remove myself from the equation entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One amusing part of the server design was how to send end user emails upon registration.  I worried about this for quite some time before using the Heroku Sendmail addon.  My concern was that I’d run out of email budget for new registrations!  I planned ahead, but never needed this functionality, since the app doesn’t create more than 10-20 emails per day…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Push notification support on Heroku was also pretty simple, due to the &lt;a title=&quot;APN on Rails&quot; href=&quot;http://apnonrails.metabates.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;APN on Rails &lt;/a&gt;plugin, but it did add cost to the server, since I found I needed a worker thread to process game status and batch up the push notifications.  I have a worker that does this every minute or so and sends out ‘it’s your turn’ messages for the games.  In all, the Heroku server costs me around $60 a month to run, and I’m delighted with how it has performed – I haven’t had a single problem or outage in the two years it has been running.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Maughan</name></author><summary type="html">This is the final part of my posts on the history of Boardz.  I’m going to talk about the artwork and the server.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A History of Boardz, Part 2</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/boardz-part2" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A History of Boardz, Part 2" /><published>2011-09-19T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2011-09-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/a-history-of-boardz-part-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/boardz-part2">&lt;p&gt;In part 1 I covered the development of Boardz up to shipping the first version.  I’d like to talk a little bit about the resulting reviews, and how these forced a course correction in the development.  I don’t think this course correction was necessarily the right move on my part, but we’ll get to that…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I got the first version out of the door, the reviews started to come in.  It’s pretty hard to live with bad reviews when you’ve put your heart and soul into a project, so I try to be fair minded and not lose it everytime somebody posts a less than happy response.  The good reviews make it all worth while, of course.  Here are a couple from the first version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This app is really great when you want to play but can’t have a board standing or if you live far from each other. Stable with a nice and easy to use interface, it’s simply great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think this app has a lot of potential and is a good first start. A few things that would make it even better:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ability to chat with your opponent. Maybe put the chat messages on the reverse side of the board.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ranking system that you can start by setting yourself but will adjust over time.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Handicap system to go with the ranking system.&lt;br /&gt;
Overall though the best app out there for playing Go right now because you don’t need to stay connected the while time.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good reviews tend to fall into these two categories – they are either along the lines of ‘great, love it’, or ‘great, but wouldn’t it be nice if…’.  I love getting either type, it’s a real validation of the work I put into these games.  Now let us look at a couple of bad ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is no computer AI in this software… you cannot play against a computer opponent. I have not used this game one time since purchasing/installing it. Completely worthless to me. Refund my money and I’ll remove this review. Yeah, I know… fat chance, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Be Aware: Bought by mistake as this is online game only!!!Need Internet connection to play with other people!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s wrong with this?  Firstly, the reviewers plainly did not read the application description before downloading Boardz.  They just bought on impulse, realized the app didn’t do what they wanted, and wrote a 1-star review (dropping my average star rating, and hurting sales).  For the record, the first version of Boardz clearly described on the first line of the description that it was an app for playing turn-based board games with friends and family over the internet.  There is no way you would read that text and come away with the impression that it supported playing against the computer.  It is also obvious that the author of the first review didn’t go back and check what he downloaded before writing a bad review.  There’s no excuse for the second reviewer in my opinion – he’s admitting he got it wrong, and then damaging my star rating just because he can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the comment ‘Refund my money and I’ll remove this review’ demonstrates a common misconception about the app store –  that I can contact this reviewer or respond to his comment, and somehow pay him a refund.  I have no way to reach a reviewer, unless he uses a username that matches something I have in the Boardz database, or is easy to google for (many reviewers use a made up name, or even random characters like a swear-bubble from Asterix…).  I’ve actually expended effort in the past to track reviewers down, especially if they have a bug report I’d like to chase up.  The most frustrating part about this App Store policy is when somebody leaves a bug report in a review.  Typically you don’t get enough information in user reports and you have to chase down repro steps – which, of course, you can’t.  I’d also like to respond to reviews like this one and say ‘hey, it says in the description what the app can do – is there some way I can make it clearer?’  As for the refund, contacting Apple will sort that out for you, but few users actually do that or even realize that it is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review policy does force a developer down one particular route – and end users might argue that it’s a good one.  The only way to counter bad reviews is to ship a new version (which removes the previous reviews from your front page on the App Store) and add the features your users are asking for.  A friend of mine in the industry once told me he had heard the best strategy for launching an iPhone game is to release it under a development name, read the reviews, fix what is missing, and then release it under a new name with everything fixed.  He may have been joking, but it would certainly work.  Faced with a mounting list of complaints about not being able to play against the computer, and various other requests such as in-game chat support,  I decided to plough on and add these features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has written an AI opponent knows that it’s not a simple project.  As of today, I’ve implemented a simple draughts engine and a very complicated Go engine for Boardz – something I’ll talk about in a later post.  I’ve also used a couple of free engines for Chess and XiangQi, along with starting a side project to write a Shogi engine too.  I didn’t really want to embark on this work, but I could not see any way to keep users happy without doing it.  On reflection if I knew what I know now, I may well have ended the project at that point and left Boardz to fester as a purely turn-based internet app – what I’d always intended it to be.  I could have used all that extra development time to start a new, more promising project.  It’s really hard to walk away from your baby though, especially if you actually think it is a good product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the AI opponents, a new opportunity presented itself in the form of the iPad.  After the announcement, I felt it was worth having a shot at building an iPad version of Boardz to ship on launch day.  Since I missed the launch of the iPhone, it seemed like an opportunity not to be missed.  Apple were promising to highlight launch day apps, and I could do with the exposure, so it was worth a shot.  I worked tirelessly on a ‘Universal Binary’ version of Boardz – meaning that the same app would run on iPhone and iPad.  The iPad version had larger, more detailed graphics, and a chat window alongside the board on the same screen.  I learned the hard way while updating to the iPad version that a lot of my artwork was insufficient for the higher resolution.  In fact, I suspect 40% of my time on the Boardz project has been dedicated to artwork, and tweaking the renderer to make everything look OK.  Having an artist on board would have made my life a lot easier.  Nevertheless, the iPad version did let Boardz shine in some ways – the Kanji characters in games like Shogi look especially good on the higher res display.  I really enjoyed seeing that for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/boardz/Shogi2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the stress of development under a timeline while working in my spare time, I managed to ship iPad support on day one (even though I couldn’t actually see it for myself, Apple assured me they tested it and it worked).  When I later got my iPad on UK launch day, I did spot some minor issues which Apple would undoubtedly have missed, but nothing that detracted from the utility of the App.  Below is a graph from March to June, showing sales in 2010.  Around the middle is the launch date of the iPad.  You can see that with the new features and launch of the iPad I started to get some more traction; although in all honesty, such small sales numbers don’t justify any of this work.  I also never really saw my app featured in any way on the app store, despite being one of the developers that followed all of Apple’s rules and got the app published on day one.  Sure, ‘Scrabble’ had top-billing, but for the little guy toiling away on his app there wasn’t really any reward for working to this deadline.  There was (as there is now), and iPad specific category on the App Store – but it was very crowded, as you’d expect, even on day one.  I could probably have shipped a week later, and it would have made no difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/boardz/AppViz-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I got the iPad version out of the door, I got some curious new feedback from users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No In Person 2 Player.  Grrr….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Doesn’t work without internet connection. No way to play with 2 players on one iPad. I wanted to play against someone else on an airplane, but it wouldn’t give me that option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting about these reviews is that they are suddenly requesting using my app as a board, for situations where you want to play against another player and you don’t one.  I guess it’s understandable on the new iPad format for people to want to do this, but curious that these two reviews arrived on launch day, almost immediately after the iPad shipped – not to mention the earlier problem that they just didn’t read the product description.  On launch day, there were several other iPad apps that had just this feature – they provided a board to play on, but with no engine/rules.  A cynical person might think that these comments were coming from my competition.  Regardless if this is true or not, I had obviously missed the opportunity to provide the same functionality.  Since it wasn’t too hard to do, I set about adding it.  In fact, it made my app more desirable than the others – at least from a game play perspective, because you could have the engine recognize the rules and take pieces off the board for you – something the other apps didn’t do.  Those apps did what I’d do in this situation – they made it a feature “Hey, you can even make up the rules!”, but I believe that’s probably not what you want most of the time.  With that small addition, along with various other bits and pieces, I think I made a difference to Boardz sales that lasts to this day, but as I’ve said, it probably wasn’t worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an iOS developer, it’s a fast-changing world out there.  If you’re a single guy, you could spend your life just keeping up with Apple’s releases of software and hardware.  The next challenges to come down the pipeline were iPhone 4 and Game Center.  iPhone 4 was pretty simple – the beautiful display on that device was easy to take advantage of, since I had most of the artwork I needed from the iPad project; the relative dimensions were very convenient for scaled up artwork.  Game Center offered another opportunity to get front and center, by featuring my app in the Game Center app, and allowing it to spread a little by word of mouth.  Along with Game Center, I even added the ability to post your victories to Facebook.  Making Boardz more social seemed like the best next step in its evolution, but like the iPad updates, these changes gave me small bumps instead of the big boost I hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve slowed down development on Boardz recently.  It would be tempting to say there’s no point flogging a dead horse, but that’s not the reason.  I just got tired doing 2 jobs, and wanted to simplify things for a while.  That doesn’t mean I’m not plugging away at it, and as I mentioned last time, I’ve been looking at hooking it up to other servers on the internet instead of my own.  Other features such as allowing the user to moderate the score in Go, and export SGF files, etc. are also very nearly done.  Who knows, iPhone 5 might spring a surprise or two that I’ll have to deal with as well.  As you may have gathered, I’ve committed the business sin of getting too attached to my product.  I keep working on it because I love it (it’s still an App I use every day – as many users have told me they do).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this post has got a bit bigger than I anticipated, I’m going to save the ‘what went right/wrong’ until the last part.  Then I’ll dig into a few of the interesting technical challenges I faced during the development.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Maughan</name></author><category term="App Store" /><category term="Apple" /><category term="Boardz" /><category term="Chess" /><category term="Game Center" /><category term="Go" /><category term="iPad" /><category term="iPhone 4" /><category term="Reviews" /><category term="Shogi" /><category term="XiangQi" /><summary type="html">In part 1 I covered the development of Boardz up to shipping the first version.  I’d like to talk a little bit about the resulting reviews, and how these forced a course correction in the development.  I don’t think this course correction was necessarily the right move on my part, but we’ll get to that…</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/%7B%22feature%22=%3E%22../wp-content/uploads/2011/09/7.jpg%22%7D" /></entry></feed>
